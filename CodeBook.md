# CODEBOOK

Data originally from [UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones).

## Brief Description of Data Set
Thirty volunteers performed six activities wearing a Samusung Galaxy S II smartphone on the waist. Researchers captured 3-axial linear acceleration and angular velocity using the phone's accelerometer and gyroscope. Please see the original website for more details.
